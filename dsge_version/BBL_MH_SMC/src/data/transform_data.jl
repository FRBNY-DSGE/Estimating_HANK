transform_data(m::AbstractDSGEModel, levels::DataFrame; cond_type::Symbol = :none,
    verbose::Symbol = :low)
```

Transform data loaded in levels and order columns appropriately for the DSGE
model. Returns DataFrame of transformed data.

The DataFrame `levels` is output from `load_data_levels`. The series in levels are
transformed as specified in `m.observable_mappings`.

- To prepare for per-capita transformations, population data are filtered using
  `hpfilter`. The series in `levels` to use as the population series is given by
  the `population_mnemonic` setting. If `use_population_forecast(m)`, a
  population forecast is appended to the recorded population levels before the
  filtering. Both filtered and unfiltered population levels and growth rates are
  added to the `levels` data frame.
- The transformations are applied for each series using the `levels` DataFrame
  as input.

Conditional data (identified by `cond_type in [:semi, :full]`) are handled
slightly differently: If `use_population_forecast(m)`, we drop the first period
of the population forecast because we treat the first forecast period
`date_forecast_start(m)` as if it were data. We also only apply transformations
for the observables given in `cond_full_names(m)` or `cond_semi_names(m)`.

```
transform_population_data(population_data, population_forecast,
    population_mnemonic; verbose = :low)
```

Load, HP-filter, and compute growth rates from population data in
levels. Optionally do the same for forecasts.

### Inputs

- `population_data`: pre-loaded DataFrame of historical population data
  containing the columns `:date` and `population_mnemonic`. Assumes this is
  sorted by date.
- `population_forecast`: pre-loaded `DataFrame` of population forecast
  containing the columns `:date` and `population_mnemonic`
- `population_mnemonic`: column name for population series in `population_data`
  and `population_forecast`

### Keyword Arguments

- `verbose`: one of `:none`, `:low`, or `:high`
- `use_hpfilter`: whether to HP filter population data and forecast. See `Output` below.
- `pad_forecast_start::Bool`: Whether you want to re-size
the population_forecast such that the first index is one quarter ahead of the last index
of population_data. Only set to false if you have manually constructed population_forecast
to artificially start a quarter earlier, so as to avoid having an unnecessary missing first entry.

### Output

Two dictionaries containing the following keys:

- `population_data_out`:
  + `:filtered_population_recorded`: HP-filtered historical population series (levels)
  + `:dlfiltered_population_recorded`: HP-filtered historical population series (growth rates)
  + `:dlpopulation_recorded`: Non-filtered historical population series (growth rates)

- `population_forecast_out`:
  + `:filtered_population_forecast`: HP-filtered population forecast series (levels)
  + `:dlfiltered_population_forecast`: HP-filtered population forecast series (growth rates)
  + `:dlpopulation_forecast`: Non-filtered historical population series (growth rates)

If `population_forecast_file` is not provided, the r\"*forecast\" fields will be
empty. If `use_hpfilter = false`, then the r\"*filtered*\" fields will be
empty.
