nearest_spd(A::Matrix)
```
Calculates the nearest (in Frobenius norm) symmetric positive semidefinite matrix to A.

From Higham: The nearest symmetric positive semidefinite matrix in the
Frobenius norm to an arbitrary real matrix A is shown to be (B + H)/2,
 where H is the symmetric polar factor of B=(A + A')/2.

### Inputs

- `A::Matrix`: A square matrix

### Outputs

- `Ahat::Matrix`: The symmetric, square positive semidefinite matrix closest to A
